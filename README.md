# birds

A replica of the popular game Angry Birds following a youtube tutorial by Jason Weimann. he player has to launch a projectile(abird) which on hitting its targets(monsters) destroys it. The bird should be launched such that allmonsters can be hit at one shot since relaunch costs a life. Currently working on adding more elements to make it more engaging
